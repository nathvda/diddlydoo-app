# diddlydoo-app

Welcome to this repository ! We are a team of 4 Junior Web Developper at BeCode and we are learning Javascript, form handling, and communication with backend, among other things. 

We worked together on this project which requested us to create an app that would allow its users to add events and check for attendance. Our tasks were :
- Display all the events, including everyone's availability
- Allow users to create events
- Allow users to add their availability to an existing event
- Edit an event name/description/author
- Delete an event
- Validate inputs before sending the data to the backend, inputs required to be filled and shorter than 256 characters. If it's not the case the request has not to be send and the appropriate error has to be displayed below the input.

The backend is not a part of this project, because it was already written beforehand.

Please, have a tour on the repository. 

Known Issues : 
- Possible to check more than one date at a time, but the date must already appeared in the json file. If it does not, it won't be updated.
